# WVU PD-6 application

Prepared by Hasith Perera on behalf of the Amateur Radio Club of West Virginia University (WVU ARC)

The Amateur radio club received a NASA Space Grant to continue High altitude ballooning science and extend the capabilities gained through NASA National Eclipse Project (NEBP) launches we participated in last year.

We plan to launch five  weather balloons to demonstrate and test the payloads that were designed and built under this grant.
## Launch dates

1. February 14 - Friday
2. March 01 - Saturday
3. March 28 - Friday
4. April 04 - Friday
5. April 18 - Friday 

Launches will be done between 1000 h - 1300 h local time depending on wind and weather conditions.
### Balloons and the attached system

- High altitude science 350 g balloons
- maximum payload weight 300 g
- Tracking using APRS - 144.390 MHz

### Description of each launch

The main goal is to collect weather data and also evaluate a number of custom tracking and data collecting systems built during this project. Each launch will evaluate incremental systems and the payload will change internally depending on what part of the system is being tested.

The tracking capability would be available on all flights. Some basic details of the planned launches

- Max payload: 300 g
- Ascent rate: 5-10 $ms^{-1}$
- max altitude: 80000 ft

### Process to get WVU permission

- Submit a UAV form with the launch date and time. I submitted the top portion of this document along with the filled form
- on the day of launch UPD Dispatch should be notified before and after launch
