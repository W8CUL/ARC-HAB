- Observations:
	- altitude encoding worked till 10:44
	- Unsure why it rolled over at that point 
	- 10:56 - 11:12 
		- GPS time was available and it beaconed the last known location
	- 11:16
		- Payload/GPS restarted - unknown reason
		- it defaulted to `AA00` since there was no GPS lock but still time lock was available
	- 11:48
		- last packet - likely GPS lost entirely
