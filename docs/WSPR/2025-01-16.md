- 
- tested FT8 Tx with arduino and rx signal with wsjtx with the tr(u)SDX  
- we were able to hear signals but did not decode. troubleshooting them now.
	- we possibly need to set arduino to sync time with global time as time syncing on both ends is very important for ft8
	- ~~time was shown to be exact on Dylans windows laptop and hasiths linux laptop, unable to check time on arduino ~~
	- *Comment TJE*: Time sync is important, but in this case I manually synced the time on the correct decode cycle. It should work

- Secondary testing on FT8 - 14073.60 MHz
	- There is a shift in frequency from what we expect and that was the primary cause the initial inputs failed
		- Input audio levels were not significant too
	- There is a frequency offset we need to evaluate
