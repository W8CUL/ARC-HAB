- We looked at schematics of [tr(usdx)](https://dl2man.de/2-trusdx-assembly/) main board and rf boards, determined that it used the Si5351 as a `clk2` source
	- it uses a NAND gate to keep the same signal but boost output to 5v. (we assume)
	- We could not find a 74xx series NAND gate and order is needed
	- Schematic section is attached below

- Drive signal is routed to a BS107 MOSFET with a 12V supply for amplification
	- Might not be feasible on a balloon
	- Next step test NAND only implementation for RF propagation within small range (ESB to Downtown)

- Basic pin out from Dylan's PCB
	- I am gonna remake this as a plugin board using JST connectors
	- 4 pin for GPS
	- 4 pin for the clock chip 
	- 6 pin for Arduino 
	- Have the filters installed on the RF PCB
