Great you have decided to get in to High altitude ballooning.... It seems overwhelming where to start at first. I am listing down step I followed to get everything ready for launching


Step to launch in WVU:
1. Decide what size of balloon you would like to launch, payload capacity, equipment and funding for it. (Talk to SGC, email ke8tje@gmail.com if needed)
2. Once you have all of this: WVU UPD permission would be the easiest to get
	- Contact UPD over the phone and find the contact details of the  officer who works with Unmanned arial vehicles. if possible talk to him and explain the requirement
		- in Spring 2025 this was Jason DeProspero jdepros1@mail.wvu.edu
		- Email him with the interest and the dates
		- you will be asked to will a WVU-PD-6 application. supporting document found [here](other/ARC%20HAB%20-%20WVU-PD-6%20application.md).
3. once you have WVU UPD permission you can use that email for facilitate most of the other requirement (door request for He storage etc.)
4. 3-5 days befor launch date FAA NOTAM needs to be filed. Process is detailed below in the next sections
5. On the day of launch: call UPD before launch and have fun

- from: 39.6463,-79.9702 (AERB feild)
- 2.9 NM west from MGW (they should give you this)
- max altitude: 80,000 (flight level 800)

## Past NOTAM numbers - Launch location AERB

- MGW02/081 : location is not correct in this one
- MGW03/005: location is the ESB 2.3 NM west of MGW
- MGW03/018: For the launch on March 28th
- MGW04/002: initials of the filing person PG

## How to predict the balloon path

- We are using https://predict.sondehub.org/
- Time needs to be converted to UTC
- launch location can be saved for ease of use
- For plotting and comparison CSV and KML file exports are possible
