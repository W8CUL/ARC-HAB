- Based on: https://predict.sondehub.org/
- Assumptions: 6.1 $ms^{-1}$ ascent
- Based on descent rate our landing location changes 

### Landing location simulation

- Burst at 21000
#### 28000 m burst and 5 m/s descent

### Descent rate calculation based on last data

- 20:49:53 138: 28 km
- 21:01:49 139: 6 km
- 7+11 $\times$ 60 +49 = 716
- calculated descend speed: 30 m/s

## Only viable launch 

- cut down payload at 6000 m
- Could be done with the APRS board
