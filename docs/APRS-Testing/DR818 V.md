## Vcc testing

- Test setup: a bench power supply was used to power the radio and the internal current meater was used for reading
- at 3.3 V
	- RF low: 0.56 A
	- RF high: 0.8 A
	- Standby: 0.05 A
- at 4.2 V
	- low: 0.67 A
	 - high: 1.2 A
- at 5.0 V
	- high: 1.3 A
- at 2.5 V or below the radio dose not TX
	- UART interface was working

### 2m filter design simulation

- A 2m filter needs to be added to the final design.
- The design was tested with KiCAD using a spice simulation and results are shown below
- 2nd Harmonic shows a ~70dB attenuation at 145 MHz

### Test filter design

- [ ] Needs to be build and measured to see how actual non ideal devices change the simulated result
- [ ] Battery voltage measurement device and logging - to evaluate the operational time
