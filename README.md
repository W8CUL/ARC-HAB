# High altitude balloon project - Documentation

Great you have decided to get in to High altitude ballooning.... It seems overwhelming where to start at first. I am listing down step I followed to get everything ready for launching

Step to launch in WVU:
1. Decide what size of balloon you would like to launch, payload capacity, equipment and funding for it. (Talk to SGC, email KE8TJE if needed)
2. Once you have all of this: WVU UPD permission would be the easiest to get
	- Contact UPD over the phone and find the contact details of the  officer who works with Unmanned arial vehicles. if possible talk to him and explain the requirement
		- in Spring 2025 this was Jason DeProspero jdepros1@mail.wvu.edu
		- Email him with the interest and the dates
		- you will be asked to fill a WVU-PD-6 application. supporting document found [here](docs/other/WVU-PD-6_application.md).
3. once you have WVU UPD permission you can use that email for facilitate most of the other requirement (door request for He storage etc.)
4. 3-5 days before the launch date, FAA NOTAM needs to be filed. Process is detailed [here](docs/Preparing_for_a_launch.md.md)
5. On the day of launch: call UPD before launch and have fun
6. If you are recovering the balloon form a search party
